This is a hamster run game that was written in android where you try to tryto keep the hamster alive as you navigate it through the maze of obstacles. The blue tiles are normal, brown are where you can pickup more food, prink are where you can get a "zoom" power up, yellow is where the human is, gray are "bars" that take 2 energy to move through, and green is the goal.

Each time you move the hamster, you use at least one unit of energy (two on gray tiles). Eating food can give you more energy, but you start with no extra food. You can get more by landing on the brown tiles. If you can make it to the green tile without looking all of your energy, you win. If you lose all your energy or get caught by the human (landing on the yellow tile), you will lose.

If you want to restart a level, just click the "restart" button in the top right.

If you use the "zoom" ability, you will be able to move two tiles in one direction using just one unit of energy.
